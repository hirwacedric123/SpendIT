# iSpendIT

iSpendIT is a robust web application for managing personal and organizational finances. It allows users to track income and expenses, categorize transactions, set budgets, and generate insightful reports to manage finances effectively. The application is built using Django for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The project is hosted on PythonAnywhere, and the live application can be accessed [here](https://ispendit.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Features

### 1. **User Management**
   - **Account Creation**: Users can register for an account using a secure registration form.
   - **Login/Logout**: Access is restricted to authenticated users. Sessions are maintained securely, and users can log out at any time.
   - **User Roles**: Admins have additional privileges to manage other users, including editing user details.

### 2. **Account Management**
   - Users can add multiple accounts to manage their finances (e.g., Cash, Bank Account, Credit Card).
   - Each account is associated with a type (e.g., Savings, Checking, Credit) and displays the current balance.
   - Balances update dynamically based on transactions linked to each account.

### 3. **Category and Subcategory Management**
   - Organize income and expenses by creating categories and subcategories.
   - For example:
     - **Income Categories**: Salary, Freelancing, Investments
     - **Expense Categories**: Groceries, Utilities, Entertainment
   - Users can add, edit, or delete categories and subcategories as needed.

### 4. **Transactions**
   - Users can record transactions (income or expense) linked to specific accounts and categories.
   - Transaction details include:
     - Amount
     - Date
     - Category/Subcategory
     - Description (optional)
   - All transactions are displayed in a table with filters for easier searching and organization.

### 5. **Advanced Filters**
   - Dynamically filter transactions by:
     - Date range (e.g., filter by a specific week or month).
     - Category/Subcategory (e.g., see only transactions related to ‚ÄúGroceries‚Äù).
     - Transaction Type (Income or Expense).
   - These filters are powered by AJAX for a smooth user experience with no page reloads.

### 6. **Budget Management**
   - Set a budget to track your expenses against a predefined limit.
   - Displays:
     - Total Budget
     - Total Expenses
     - Remaining Budget
   - Alerts are shown if the user exceeds their budget.
   - Budget updates dynamically based on transactions.

### 7. **Reports and Visualizations**
   - Generate visualized reports (e.g., bar charts, pie charts) to analyze spending and income patterns.
   - Summaries include total expenses by category, income vs. expenses, and account balances over time.

### 8. **Real-Time Feedback**
   - If the remaining budget goes negative, users receive alerts to manage their spending.
   - Transaction forms dynamically update without refreshing the page, ensuring a smooth user experience.
